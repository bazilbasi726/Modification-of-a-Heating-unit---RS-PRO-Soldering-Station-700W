# Modification-of-a-Heating-unit---RS-PRO-Soldering-Station-700W
This project focuses on developing a digitally controlled heating system for precise temperature Regulation and controll. A commercial RS PRO 858D SMD rework station was reverse-engineered and transformed into a microcontroller-based system using Arduino Mega 2560 with MAX31865/PT1000 and MAX31855 thermocouple sensors.
